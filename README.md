# dungeon-crawler
A generic, text-based dungeon crawler to learn Python. 
In Spring 2016, I built a similar program for my CompS 327 program as a way for the class to learn C and C++. Since that project was designed to teach students everything from the basics of C to data structures in C++, I figured that it'd be a good project to learn Python which. Not to mention, just being a bunch of fun to write.

## Things to keep in mind
Tiles are arranged within the board as [y][x] as opposed to [x][y]. The ordering for this is to simplify the rendering process
